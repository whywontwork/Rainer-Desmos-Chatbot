# Claude Assistant with Desmos Integration

A web-based client for interacting with Anthropic's Claude AI models, featuring integrated Desmos graphing calculator functionality.

## Features

- Clean, intuitive chat interface for Claude interactions
- Integrated Desmos graphing calculator for mathematical visualizations
- Automatic equation detection and plotting
- Direct point and equation plotting commands
- File and image uploads to Claude
- Customizable themes and appearance settings
- Local chat history storage and management
- API usage tracking and optimization

## Directory Structure

The application is organized into the following modules:

- `/api` - API client and file handling
- `/config` - Configuration management and settings
- `/core` - Core application functionality
- `/desmos` - Desmos calculator integration
- `/ui` - Styling and UI components

## Installation

### Server Setup (Required)

1. Clone the repository 
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the proxy server:
   ```bash
   node server.mjs
   ```
4. Open `index.html` in your browser or access the deployed site

The server is required as it acts as a proxy for API communication, avoiding CORS issues with the Anthropic API. For deployment on platforms like render.com, you need to deploy both the frontend files and the server component.

## Usage

### Basic Chat

Type messages in the input box and press Enter or click Send to chat with Claude. The conversation will appear in the chat area above.

### Desmos Integration

- Click the "ðŸ“Š Graph" button in the top menu to toggle the Desmos calculator
- Type `plot (x,y)` to plot a specific point
- Type `plot y=x^2` to plot an equation
- Claude will automatically detect equations in its responses and offer to plot them

### File Uploads

Click "Attach Files" to upload documents or images to include with your next message.

### System Prompt

Click "â–º System Prompt" to expand the system prompt input area, where you can provide instructions that guide Claude's behavior throughout the conversation.

## Configuration

Edit settings through the Settings menu, including:

- API Key
- Theme selection
- Font size
- Model selection

## Deployment

To deploy on render.com or similar platforms:

1. Set up a web service that runs `node server.mjs`
2. Configure the service to serve static files from the project directory
3. Make sure to include all necessary dependencies in your deploy

## Development

### Key Files

- `server.mjs` - Express proxy server for Claude API communication (required)
- `index.html` - Main application HTML
- `core/app.js` - Core application logic
- `api/api.js` - API client and helpers
- `desmos/desmos-core.js` - Desmos integration
- `desmos/equation-processor.js` - Equation detection and processing
- `config/config.js` - Configuration management
- `ui/styles.css` - Styling

### API Proxy

The application uses a server-side proxy to communicate with the Anthropic API for several reasons:
- Avoids CORS issues that occur with browser-based API calls
- Keeps API keys more secure by not exposing them in browser code
- Allows standardizing requests and handling errors consistently

The frontend code automatically determines the correct proxy URL based on the environment.
