# Enhanced Web Search with Content Extraction

## Overview

We've completely redesigned the web search functionality to:

1. Perform real searches on DuckDuckGo instead of using predefined examples
2. Extract the actual content from the top search results 
3. Format the results in a structured way for Claude to process
4. Provide the information to Claude in a consistent format

The new format structures search results exactly as requested:

```
user input: [original query]
information gathered source 1: [title, URL, and extracted content]
information gathered source 2: [title, URL, and extracted content]
```

## Implementation Details

### New Files

1. **search-integration-improved.js**
   - Core implementation for enhanced search
   - Content extraction logic
   - Structured format handling

2. **directsearch-endpoint.js**
   - Server endpoint for performing searches
   - Parses HTML using Cheerio
   - Follows links to extract actual content

3. **websearchjs-enhanced.js**
   - Updated WebSearchIntegration class
   - Handles the search workflow
   - Formats search results for Claude

4. **app-search-integration.js**
   - Integration code for core/app.js
   - Connects the search results to the API

### Features

#### 1. Real Search Results
The system now actually searches the web through DuckDuckGo and extracts real search results.

#### 2. Content Extraction
Instead of just using snippets, the system:
- Follows links from search results
- Extracts the actual content from web pages
- Cleans and formats the content for readability

#### 3. Structured Format
Search results are provided to Claude in a consistent format:
```
user input: [query]
information gathered source 1: [content]
information gathered source 2: [content]
```

#### 4. Error Handling
The system includes robust error handling:
- Timeouts for slow websites
- Fallbacks for failed extractions
- Alternative content sources when primary extraction fails

## Testing

Test the enhanced search with queries like:
- "What's the current weather in London?"
- "Latest news about AI"
- "Who is the current president of France?"
- "https://example.com" (direct URL extraction)

The system will:
1. Perform the search
2. Extract content from the search results
3. Format the information in the structured format
4. Send it to Claude for processing
5. Return a comprehensive answer based on the real information

## Installation

To use the enhanced search:

1. Update the server.mjs file with the new directsearch-endpoint.js code
2. Replace websearchjs.js with the enhanced version
3. Add the new search integration code to core/app.js

## Note

Always ensure the server is running on the correct port (10000 by default) to handle the search requests properly.
