# Web Search Improvements

## Enhancements to the Search Functionality

We've made significant improvements to the web search functionality:

1. **Real Web Search**: The search functionality now performs actual searches on DuckDuckGo rather than using predetermined results.

2. **HTML Parsing**: The system uses Cheerio to parse the HTML response from DuckDuckGo and extract real search results.

3. **Result Extraction**:
   - Title, URL, and snippet are extracted from each search result
   - Limited to 5 results for better readability
   - Properly handles DuckDuckGo's URL structure
   - Checks for knowledge panels and instant answers

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: The system still includes the original fallback mechanism for when search services are unavailable, but now uses it only when real search fails.

5. **Weather Search**: Special handling for weather queries, combining real search results with simulated weather data when appropriate.

## Implementation Files

We've organized the implementation into multiple files:

- `search.js`: Contains core logic for parsing DuckDuckGo search results
- `search-integration.js`: Provides search API with fallback handling
- `server-implementation.js`: The server endpoint implementation

## Usage

To use the improved search functionality:

1. Ask any real-time information question (e.g., "What's the weather in Boston?" or "Latest news about AI")
2. Provide a URL to scrape content from
3. Ask a question that requires up-to-date information

When Claude indicates knowledge limitations, the system will automatically trigger a web search and provide real results.

## Testing

You can test the improved search by asking questions like:

- "What's the population of Berlin?"
- "Latest news on climate change"
- "Current weather in San Francisco"
- "What's the capital of Australia?"
- "Who won the world cup last year?"

The system will now return real search results instead of the predetermined examples shown previously.

## Note

The search functionality requires the server to be running on port 10000. Make sure to start the server with:

```
node server.mjs
```
